\title{Efficient rewiring of directed signed graphs}
\description{Optimal implementation of the switching algorithm. It returns the rewired version of the initial directed signed graph (dsg).} 
\usage{birewire.rewire.dsg(dsg,exact=FALSE,verbose=1,max.iter.pos='n',max.iter.neg='n',
  accuracy=0.00005,MAXITER_MUL=10,path=NULL,delimitators=list(positive='+',negative= '-'))
}
\arguments{
 \item{dsg}{A dsg object: is a list of two incidence matrices (see References), "positive" and "negative", encoding the positive edges and negative edges. This list can be obtained reading a SIF file using \code{birewire.load.dsg} function and converting the resulting dataframe using \code{birewire.induced.bipartite};}
   \item{exact}{ FALSE (default). If TRUE the program performs \emph{max.iter} \strong{successful} swithcing steps, otherwise the program will count also the not-performed swithcing steps;}
    \item{verbose}{ TRUE (default). When TRUE a progression bar is printed during computation;}

  \item{max.iter.pos}{ "n" (default)  the number of switching steps to be performed on the positive part of  \emph{dsg} (or if \emph{exact==TRUE} the number of \strong{successful} switching steps). If equal to "n" then this number is considered equal to the analytically derived lower bound presented in \emph{Gobbi et al.} (see References): \eqn{N={e}/{2(1-d)} \ln{((e-de)/\delta)} } if exact is FALSE, \eqn{N={e(1-d)}/{2} \ln{((e-de)/\delta)} } otherwise ,  
  where \eqn{e}  is the number of edges of \emph{g} and \eqn{d} its edge density . This bound is much lower than the empirical one proposed  in  \emph{Milo et al. 2003} (see References);}   
  \item{max.iter.neg}{ "n" (default)  the number of switching steps to be performed on the negative part of  \emph{dsg} (or if \emph{exact==TRUE} the number of \strong{successful} switching steps). If equal to "n" then this number is considered equal to the analytically derived lower bound presented in \emph{Gobbi et al.} (see References): \eqn{N={e}/{2(1-d)} \ln{((e-de)/\delta)} } if exact is FALSE, \eqn{N={e(1-d)}/{2} \ln{((e-de)/\delta)} } otherwise ,  
  where \eqn{e}  is the number of edges of \emph{g} and \eqn{d} its edge density . This bound is much lower than the empirical one proposed  in  \emph{Milo et al. 2003} (see References);}   
 \item{accuracy}{ 0.00005 (default) is the desired level of accuracy reflecting the average distance between the Jaccard index at the N-th step and its analytically derived fixed point in terms of fracion of common edges;}
      \item{MAXITER_MUL}{ 10 (default). If \emph{exact==TRUE}  in order to prevent a possible infinite loop the program stops anyway after MAXITER_MUL*max.iter iterations;}

   \item{path}{ NULL (default). If not NULL, the dsg is saved in \emph{path} in SIF format; }  
    \item{delimitators}{ list(positive='+',negative= '-') (default). If \emph{save.file} is true, the dsg is saved  using \emph{delimitators} as characters encoding the relations. See \code{birewire.build.dsg} for more details. }
