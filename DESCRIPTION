Title: High-performing routines for the randomization of a bipartite
        graph (or a binary event matrix) preserving degree distribution
        (or marginal totals).
Maintainer: Andrea Gobbi <gobbi.andrea@mail.com>
Description: Fast functions for bipartite network rewiring through N
        consecutive switching steps (See References) and for the
        computation of the minimal number of switching steps to be
        performed in order to maximise the dissimilarity with respect
        to the original network. Includes function for the analysis of
        the introduced randomness across the switching and several
        other routines to analyse the resulting networks and their
        natural projections. Extension to undirected networks (not
        bipartite) is also provided.
